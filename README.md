### A reminder on academic integrity
As mentioned in the syllabus, learning from examples and online resources is an important part of becoming a developer — but submitting someone else’s work as your own is not.  
It’s encouraged to reference examples, frameworks, or tutorials to understand how things work, but the final project should always represent your own effort and understanding.  
If I ever felt unsure about whether using something was appropriate, I would ask the course staff for clarification.

Talking to classmates to share ideas or get feedback is allowed, but all of the work I’m submitting here was created and written by me.

## 2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include?

**(a) Basic features**  
My portfolio includes a navigation bar, hero section with my name and photo, an “About” section, and a creative “What’s in My Brain” section.  
It also has contact links, lists, and alt text for images to improve accessibility.

**(b) CSS features**  
I used an external stylesheet to control the entire design. The layout is built with a responsive grid that adjusts to smaller screens.  
I created a soft pink and lilac color palette, styled buttons and hover effects, made the navigation bar sticky with a blur effect, and added circular “pill” tags for my quick facts.  
I also included accessibility features like a skip link and support for users who prefer reduced motion.

**(c) Advanced features (CSS only)**  
1. A “What’s in my Brain” animation where skill bubbles pop out around a brain emoji using only CSS keyframes.  
2. A subtle ticker that scrolls my skill list below the hero section.  
3. Rotating decorative rings around my profile photo using gradients and smooth animation.

## 3. Accessibility checker notes

I ran WAVE and corrected every major issue.  
- The rotating rings are decorative and marked with `aria-hidden="true"`.  
- The brain emoji uses `role="img"` and an `aria-label` for screen readers.  
- The skip link at the top lets keyboard users jump straight to the main content.  

A few small warnings (like duplicate internal anchors) are intentional and don’t affect accessibility.

## 4. Time spent

I spent about **12 hours total**, including planning, coding, styling, fixing layout issues, and validating HTML/CSS.

## 5. Online resources consulted

- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer)  
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)  
- [WAVE Accessibility Checker](https://wave.webaim.org/)  
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) for CSS animations, gradients, and responsive layouts  
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for Playfair Display and Poppins

## 6. Classmates or others consulted

I talked with a classmate about general layout ideas and validator links but did not share or use any of their code. Everything in my final version was written and customized by me.

## 7. Anything special to run my code?

Nothing special is needed.  
You can open `index.html` in any web browser, or view it live through GitHub Pages:
